## About the Video Course
Your bodyguard for when data gets too big, this course is strong but friendly, funny yet deep, animated yet thoughtful. Let’s parse that. Your bodyguard for when data gets too big: Most business folks (and quite a few engineers) use Excel as a basic tool of decision making and modeling, but when you can't fit the data you'd like into an Excel spreadsheet that you can easily open, its time to move to a database. The course is strong but friendly: This course will help you move to a database without being intimidated by the new environment. Don't let anyone tell you that any dataset is too large or too complicated for you to understand. The course is funny yet deep: It goes really deep into the topics that folks often find hard to understand, such as joins, aggregate operators and interfacing with databases from a programming language. But it never takes itself too seriously. The course is very visual: most of the techniques are explained with the help of animations to help you understand better. This course is practical as well: Queries are explained in excruciating detail, indices are demystified, and potentially career-limiting traps (Drop, Alter) are marked with bright yellow tape markers so you can steer clear. The course is also quirky. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.
